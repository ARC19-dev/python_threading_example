# Python Threading Examples

This Python threading example is a script I whipped up to showcase how threading works. It will go hand in hand with a write up I posted on Medium.

To check how the file works, simply run the file with the `--help` flag.

There are two versions of the example (python2.7 and python3) since the switch to python3 happened only this past January. While there are next to no code changes, I wanted to demonstrate how using my helper function `log` to encapsulate `print` calls allowed me to copy-paste the script from 3 to 2.7 and change 2 lines of code instead of every single print statement in the document. Also note, the program creates a `*.log` file for all your viewing pleasure.
